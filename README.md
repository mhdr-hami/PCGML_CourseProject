Level Blending with Evolutionary Algorithm in Latent Space of VQ-VAE,
In this work, (1) an exploratory study about the effec- tiveness of VQ-VAEs and their discrete latent space is con- ducted. Moreover, (2) an evolutionary search algorithm (to be specific Genetic Algorithm) in the latent space of VQ- VAE is used to help us inject controlled creativity into the blended maps using mutation and create new maps at a de- sirable level of blending by using a fitness function over tile distributions. We also, (3) present that changing the latent vector elements of one SMB map with elements of KI leads to interpolation between maps. Finally, (4) the combination of VQ-VAE with an evolutionary search algorithm (to be specific Genetic Algorithm) is compared with GA and VQ-VAE itself using two evaluation metrics, Expressive Range Analysis, and Quantify Span of Generation (QSG).
